This is my coding test submission for my application at Tonic. I used Sqlite for the database and DevExtreme for the front end list. Unfortunately I ran out of time before implementing the update functionality. (I realized too late that the DevExtreme list component doesn't have native support for editing items. I was also thinking about adding checkboxes to mark items as complete, but I didn't have enough time to figure out how to do that. I know I could override the default row template to include a checkbox, but it would have taken too long for me to get it working.)
